## Technical Decisions
1. **Database**: SQLite for development simplicity, with option for SQL Server in production
2. **Architecture**: Clean Architecture pattern for maintainability
3. **UI Framework**: Blazor for full-stack C# development
4. **Calendar**: Google Calendar API for robust scheduling features
5. **SMS**: Using tel: protocol for universal compatibility

## Questions/Considerations
1. Should we use Blazor Server or WebAssembly? (Server recommended for simpler deployment)
2. Need Google Workspace account details for Calendar API setup
3. Consider adding email notifications as a future feature
4. May need to handle recurring appointments in the future
