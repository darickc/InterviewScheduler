# TimePeriodLibrary Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to integrate the TimePeriodLibrary.NET package into the InterviewScheduler application to enhance time period management and appointment scheduling capabilities.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Implementation
- **Basic DateTime operations** throughout the codebase
- **Manual time slot generation** with 30-minute intervals
- **Simple conflict detection** using LINQ queries
- **Limited time period validation** capabilities

### Key Components Currently Using Time Management
1. **Appointment Entity** (`/src/InterviewScheduler.Core/Entities/Appointment.cs`)
   - Uses simple `DateTime ScheduledTime` property
   - Duration stored separately in `AppointmentType.Duration`

2. **TimeSlot Class** (`/src/InterviewScheduler.Core/Interfaces/ICalendarService.cs`)
   - Basic StartTime/EndTime DateTime properties
   - IsAvailable boolean flag

3. **GoogleCalendarService** (`/src/InterviewScheduler.Infrastructure/Services/GoogleCalendarService.cs`)
   - Manual time slot generation in `GetAvailableTimeSlotsAsync()`
   - Basic overlap detection using DateTime comparisons

4. **AppointmentWizard** (`/src/InterviewScheduler.Web/Components/Pages/AppointmentWizard.razor`)
   - Simple availability checking
   - Basic conflict detection logic

## TimePeriodLibrary Features to Leverage

### Core Classes
- **TimeRange**: For defining appointment time periods
- **TimeBlock**: For fixed-duration appointments
- **TimePeriodCollection**: For managing multiple appointments
- **TimeInterval**: For precise time boundary handling

### Key Methods
- `HasInside()`: Check if appointment fits within working hours
- `GetIntersection()`: Find scheduling conflicts
- `IntersectionPeriods()`: Identify all overlapping appointments
- `IsSamePeriod()`: Compare time periods for equality

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Dependencies ✅ COMPLETED
**Tasks:**
- [x] Add `TimePeriodLibrary.NET` v2.1.6 to `InterviewScheduler.Infrastructure.csproj`
- [x] Add package reference to `InterviewScheduler.Core.csproj` if needed
- [x] Verify compatibility with .NET 8.0

**Command:**
```bash
dotnet add src/InterviewScheduler.Infrastructure/InterviewScheduler.Infrastructure.csproj package TimePeriodLibrary.NET --version 2.1.6
```

### Phase 2: Core Entity Enhancements ✅ COMPLETED
**Tasks:**
- [x] Create `AppointmentTimeRange` class extending TimeRange
- [x] Add TimePeriod properties to Appointment entity
- [x] Create `WorkingHours` configuration class
- [x] Update `TimeSlot` to use TimeRange internally
- [x] Create extension methods for DateTime/TimeRange conversion
- [x] Add time period validation helpers

**New Classes to Create:**
```csharp
// AppointmentTimeRange.cs
public class AppointmentTimeRange : TimeRange
{
    public int AppointmentId { get; set; }
    public int LeaderId { get; set; }
    public string AppointmentType { get; set; }
}

// WorkingHours.cs
public class WorkingHours
{
    public TimeRange MorningSession { get; set; }
    public TimeRange AfternoonSession { get; set; }
    public TimePeriodCollection BreakTimes { get; set; }
}
```

### Phase 3: Calendar Service Refactoring ✅ COMPLETED
**Tasks:**
- [x] Update `ICalendarService` interface with TimePeriod methods
- [x] Refactor `GoogleCalendarService.GetAvailableTimeSlotsAsync()`
- [x] Implement `TimePeriodCollection` for conflict detection
- [x] Add `IsTimeSlotAvailableAsync()` using TimeRange

**Key Changes:**
1. Replace manual time slot generation with TimeBlock iterations
2. Use `TimePeriodCollection.IntersectionPeriods()` for conflict detection
3. Implement `TimeRange.HasInside()` for working hours validation

### Phase 4: Business Logic Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED
**Tasks:**
- [x] Create `SchedulingRulesService` for business rules
- [x] Implement working hours validation
- [x] Add buffer time between appointments
- [x] Support recurring availability patterns
- [x] Enhance AppointmentType with scheduling-specific properties
- [x] Create SchedulingConfiguration for system-wide rules
- [x] Register services in dependency injection container

**Implemented Service Methods:**
```csharp
public interface ISchedulingRulesService
{
    bool IsWithinWorkingHours(TimeRange appointment, WorkingHours? workingHours = null);
    TimePeriodCollection GetBlockedPeriods(DateTime date, int? leaderId = null, WorkingHours? workingHours = null);
    TimeSpan GetRequiredBufferTime(AppointmentType appointmentType);
    ValidationResult ValidateSchedulingConstraints(TimeRange appointment, AppointmentType appointmentType, int leaderId, IEnumerable<Appointment> existingAppointments, WorkingHours? workingHours = null);
    bool ValidateBufferTime(TimeRange appointment, AppointmentType appointmentType, IEnumerable<Appointment> existingAppointments, int leaderId);
    TimePeriodCollection GetAvailableSlots(DateTime date, AppointmentType appointmentType, int leaderId, IEnumerable<Appointment> existingAppointments, WorkingHours? workingHours = null);
    bool IsDateAvailable(DateTime date, int? leaderId = null);
    WorkingHours GetDefaultWorkingHours();
    WorkingHours GetWorkingHoursForLeader(int leaderId);
    ValidationResult ValidateAppointmentTypeConstraints(AppointmentType appointmentType, DateTime proposedTime, int duration);
    IEnumerable<TimeRange> SuggestAlternativeTimeSlots(DateTime requestedTime, AppointmentType appointmentType, int leaderId, IEnumerable<Appointment> existingAppointments, int searchDays = 7, WorkingHours? workingHours = null);
}
```

### Phase 5: UI Component Updates ✅ COMPLETED
**Tasks:**
- [x] Update `AppointmentWizard` to use enhanced validation
- [x] Improve time slot display with better availability info
- [x] Add visual indicators for scheduling constraints
- [x] Enhance conflict resolution suggestions

**UI Improvements:**
- Show working hours boundaries
- Display buffer times visually
- Highlight scheduling conflicts
- Suggest alternative time slots

### Phase 6: Testing and Validation
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Unit tests for TimePeriod operations
- [ ] Integration tests for scheduling scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing for large appointment sets
- [ ] Edge case validation (timezone, DST, etc.)

## Migration Strategy

### Data Migration
- Existing appointments remain unchanged
- New TimePeriod properties added alongside existing DateTime
- Gradual migration through dual-support period

### Rollback Plan
- Keep original DateTime properties
- Feature flag for TimePeriod functionality
- Ability to disable new features if issues arise

## Benefits Expected

### Immediate Benefits
- **Robust conflict detection** using proven algorithms
- **Cleaner code** with purpose-built time period classes
- **Better performance** for complex scheduling queries
- **Reduced bugs** from manual DateTime calculations

### Future Capabilities
- **Recurring appointments** support
- **Complex availability patterns** (e.g., every other Tuesday)
- **Time zone aware scheduling**
- **Holiday and blackout period management**
- **Resource scheduling** (rooms, equipment)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Library is mature and well-tested
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Incremental implementation possible

### Mitigation Strategies
- Extensive testing before production
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Monitoring for performance impacts
- Documentation of all changes

## Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 1**: 1 hour (setup)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 hours (entity updates)
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 hours (service refactoring)
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 hours (business logic)
- **Phase 5**: 2-3 hours (UI updates)
- **Phase 6**: 2-3 hours (testing)

**Total Estimate**: 12-17 hours

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this plan
2. Create feature branch for implementation
3. Begin with Phase 1 setup
4. Implement incrementally with testing
5. Document API changes
6. Deploy with feature flags

## Notes
- Consider creating a separate `InterviewScheduler.Scheduling` project for scheduling logic
- Evaluate need for caching time period calculations
- Consider adding scheduling analytics features
- Plan for future multi-calendar support
